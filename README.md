I'm glad to create a comprehensive README for my e-commerce project on GitHub:
I made a full e-commerce system that enables users to buy some products and add items and also delete them from cart.
It's user-friendly.
You can have an account and add your details like name,id and address.
You can cancel or confirm your order.
At the end you get the total price of the products that you baught.

I used Java for coding.
I used Swing for the gui.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Project has 8 classes and 2 gui panels.
The classes are:Product,ElectronicProduct,ClothingProduct,BookProduct,Customer,Cart,Order,EcommerceSystem.
The first gui panel is for customer deatils(name, password,id and address).
The second gui panel is for adding and deleteing items to the cart.
